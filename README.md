# alifornia-Housing-Valuation-A-Geo-XAI-Approach
This project aims to build a robust valuation model for California real estate by fusing **Geospatial Analysis** with **Machine Learning**. Unlike traditional models that treat location merely as coordinates, this approach engineers spatial features (specifically proximity to the coastline) to capture the non-linear economic value of "location".
